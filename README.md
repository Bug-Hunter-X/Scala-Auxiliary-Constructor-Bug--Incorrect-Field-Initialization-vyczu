# Scala Auxiliary Constructor Bug
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Scala related to auxiliary constructors and improper field initialization. The `MyClass` example shows an auxiliary constructor that fails to correctly initialize the `x` field, leading to potential unexpected behavior.

The solution involves ensuring that all fields are properly initialized within the auxiliary constructor, even if they are initialized using values from other constructors. This is crucial to avoid potential null pointer exceptions or unexpected field values.
